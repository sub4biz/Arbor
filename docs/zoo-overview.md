# Benchmark Zoo

Arbor's workflow is to take a task that prints a score and iteratively edit the code, run
the eval, and keep the changes that improve the score. The **benchmark zoo** is a collection
of such tasks, each packaged in one standard format so it can be handed directly to Arbor to
optimize. It lives in [`arbor-zoo/`](https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/Arbor/tree/main/arbor-zoo),
one folder per benchmark.

## What it's for

- **Ready-to-run optimization tasks.** Each benchmark ships an eval script and a baseline;
  point Arbor at it and it begins optimizing.
- **Onboard your own task.** If you have code but no runnable eval, one command adds the eval
  scaffolding.
- **Collect new ones (in progress).** Describe what you want in natural language and have
  Arbor search GitHub / HuggingFace / arXiv, judge the candidates, fetch one, and bring up
  its baseline — or point it straight at a repo URL.

## What a benchmark contains

Each benchmark is a directory with three parts:

- a **README** — the task description: what the task is, the metric, and what Arbor may edit;
  read by Arbor during intake;
- **baseline code** — the starting point for optimization, and the only part Arbor may edit
  (e.g. `solution.py`);
- an **eval script** — prints one `score:` line when run; it is protected, so Arbor cannot
  modify it.

Arbor's loop is: edit the baseline → run the eval → keep the change if the score improved,
and repeat.

## Entry points

| Purpose | Command |
| --- | --- |
| List the benchmarks | `arbor benchmark list` |
| Run Arbor on a benchmark | copy it out of the repo, `git init`, run `arbor` inside it |
| Verify a benchmark's structure | `arbor benchmark verify <dir>` |
| Make your code a runnable benchmark | `arbor benchmark scaffold <dir>` |
| Find & fetch a benchmark | `arbor benchmark add "<query>"` (or a repo URL) `--bringup` |

Running one:

```bash
cp -r arbor-zoo/algotune_knn /tmp/algotune_knn   # copy out of the Arbor repo
cd /tmp/algotune_knn && git init -q && git add -A && git commit -qm baseline
arbor                                             # confirm the task, then it iterates
```

## Status

- **Available:** the format, `verify`, `list`, `scaffold`, the `add` spine, and the first
  example benchmark, `algotune_knn`.
- **In progress:** strengthening `add` (research the benchmark and bring its baseline up), and
  adding more benchmarks.

For the exact format, see the [format reference](zoo.md); for the wider plan, see the
[roadmap](roadmap.md).
