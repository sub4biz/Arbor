**Arbor is an autonomous research agent that turns a long-horizon objective into a
cumulative search.** Give it a benchmark and a goal; it proposes hypotheses, edits
code, runs real experiments, learns from the results, and keeps the improvements that
hold up on held-out data. Instead of one-shot attempts that forget what failed, Arbor
grows a **hypothesis tree**: every idea becomes a branch — pruned if it fails,
harvested if it works — and insights propagate back so later ideas start smarter.

Arbor runs **two cooperating agents**:

- **Coordinator** — the research director. It maintains the Idea Tree, drives the
  search via the *arbor cycle*, and dispatches experiments.
- **Executor** — the research engineer. Given one idea, it faithfully implements the
  code changes, runs the experiment in an isolated git worktree, and reports evidence.

<table>
<tr><td><b>Cumulative hypothesis tree</b></td><td>Results, failure modes, and distilled insights persist in the Idea Tree and propagate back up — so later ideas start smarter instead of being lost in a scrollback buffer.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Held-out discipline by default</b></td><td>Executors iterate on a dev split; only gains that clear a configurable margin on a held-out test split are merged. No overfitting to the metric you optimize.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Isolated, reversible experiments</b></td><td>Every experiment runs in its own git worktree on a dedicated branch. Your <code>main</code> is never touched until you merge.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Built for real experiments</b></td><td>Long-running training is first-class: generous timeouts, partial-metric recovery on timeout, and optional staged budgets (smoke → pilot → full).</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Use any model</b></td><td>Anthropic, OpenAI / Responses API, or anything OpenAI-compatible through LiteLLM (DeepSeek, Gemini, Qwen, vLLM, Ollama, local gateways).</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Steer &amp; adapt</b></td><td>A live terminal dashboard and read-only WebUI, optional human-in-the-loop at ideation/review, and one-line domain plugins — no code changes.</td></tr>

## CLI And Skill Versions

This repository includes two ways to use Arbor:

| Version | Location | Best for | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Native CLI runtime | Python package and `arbor` command | Real Arbor research runs, long experiments, dashboard, checkpoints, executor tools, merge/test discipline, plugins, reports | Recommended. This path is more complete, more reliable, and gives the best Arbor behavior. |
| Agent Skill Suite | [`skills/`](skills/README.md) | Codex or Claude Code environments where you want Arbor-style behavior without running the native Arbor runtime | Useful integration layer and fallback, but less complete than the CLI runtime. |

If you can run the CLI, use the CLI. The native `arbor` runtime contains the full
implementation: intake, Research Contract, live dashboard, EventBus,
checkpoint/resume, executor dispatch, protected dev/test evaluation discipline,
SearchAgent, plugins, and final report generation.

The repo-root [`skills/`](skills/README.md) directory is a Codex/Claude Code
skill suite. After installation, invoke `$arbor-research-agent` in Codex or
`/arbor-research-agent` in Claude Code and describe your research objective as
you would in Arbor. The skill suite performs Arbor-style clarification first
when target, metric, data, permissions, budget, or run mode are unclear, then
loads the orchestrator and phase skills. This is separate from the internal
runtime skills stored under `src/skills/`.

## Install

**Requirements:** Python ≥ 3.10 and Git. A virtual environment is recommended.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/Arbor.git
cd Arbor
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # recommended
pip install -e .                                    # or: uv pip install -e .
arbor doctor                                        # verify PATH, git, API keys
```

> Prefer a global command? `pipx install -e .` makes `arbor` available everywhere.
> For the docs site, `pip install -e ".[docs]" && mkdocs serve`, or read them online
> via the **Docs** badge above.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
arbor setup       # one-time: configure provider / model / base_url / API key
arbor             # start an interactive session in the current directory
arbor doctor      # diagnose the install
```

`arbor setup` writes `~/.arbor/config.yaml`, so day-to-day you can just run `arbor`
with no flags. The first thing Arbor does is an **intake conversation** that turns your
goal, target directory, metric, baseline, budget, dev/test discipline, and artifact
paths into a one-screen **Arbor Research Contract**. Once you confirm it, the live
dashboard takes over.

```bash
# Point at a benchmark directory and a config
arbor --cwd ./benchmark --config research_config.yaml

# Give an initial goal up front; intake refines the rest
arbor "improve validation score without touching the test split" --cwd ./benchmark

# Small dry run
arbor --cwd ./benchmark --config research_config.yaml --max-cycles 3
```

During a run you can type `/status`, `/tree`, `/evidence`, `/branches`, `/cost`,
`/pause`, `/resume`, `/report`, or `/abort`.

### Prepare a benchmark

Your target directory should have:

- a runnable evaluation script (e.g. `run_eval.py`),
- evaluation data (ideally a **dev** split and a held-out **test** split), and
- a clean git repository (no uncommitted changes).

A minimal `research_config.yaml`:

```yaml
# LLM/API live in `arbor setup`; project config is usually just the task and budget.
task: >
  Optimize the agent's accuracy on the benchmark.
  Do NOT modify the evaluation harness or data files.

coordinator:
  max_cycles: 10          # arbor cycles to explore
  max_depth: 2            # Idea Tree depth
  merge_threshold: 5.0    # min held-out % gain to merge into trunk
  ui:
    interaction_mode: review   # auto | direction | review | collaborative

executor:
  max_turns: 100
```

A copy-pasteable example with every option lives in
[`examples/research_config.example.yaml`](examples/research_config.example.yaml).

## How It Works

### The arbor cycle

Each cycle runs six steps:

```
① OBSERVE   analyze current results and failure modes
② IDEATE    propose 1–3 new ideas from the analysis and tree insights
③ SELECT    pick the highest-priority idea to test
④ DISPATCH  run an Executor on it in an isolated git worktree
⑤ BACKPROP  record the result; abstract the insight up to ancestor nodes
⑥ DECIDE    continue / merge into trunk / prune / stop
```

### The Idea Tree

```
ROOT (baseline: 20%)
├── 1: Retrieval optimization        [insight: "retrieval quality is the bottleneck"]
│   ├── 1.1: Constraint decomposition + verification   [40%, merged]
│   ├── 1.2: Periodic re-read injection                [40%, pruned — no net gain]
│   └── 1.3: Answer-extraction tuning                  [35%, pruned]
├── 2: Multi-perspective search      [insight: "search scaffolding hurts here"]
│   └── 2.1: Breadth-first search                      [25%, pruned]
└── 3: Code-level intervention       [insight: "code-level > prompt-level"]
    ├── 3.1: Continuation injection                    [70%, merged]
    └── 3.2: ANSWER-tag extraction                     [45%, done]
```

- **Depth 0 (Root):** the research objective and global insights.
- **Depth 1:** research directions (paper-title-level ideas).
- **Depth 2+:** concrete methods, implemented and tested by Executors.

### Git strategy & evaluation

Each Executor works in its own worktree on a dedicated branch. Verified improvements merge
into a per-run `trunk`; you promote `trunk` into `main` only when satisfied
(`git merge research/run_xxx/trunk`). Executors iterate on a **dev** split, but a change is
kept only if it clears a margin on the **held-out test** split — guarding against
overfitting.

### Human-in-the-loop

Set `ui.interaction_mode` (or `--interaction-mode`) to choose how much you steer:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` | Fully autonomous. |
| `direction` | Asks you where to go next at ideation. |
| `review` | Pauses before each node and Executor. |
| `collaborative` | `direction` + `review`. |

When paused, your input opens an isolated discussion with a read-only companion — it never
pollutes the Coordinator's context. See [`docs/`](docs/index.md) for the full method.

---

## Configuration

LLM access is configured once with `arbor setup` (stored in `~/.arbor/config.yaml`) via a
single `provider` field — `anthropic`, `openai` (incl. any OpenAI-compatible Responses
endpoint), or `litellm` for DeepSeek / Gemini / Qwen / vLLM / Ollama / local gateways. Keys
come from the environment or the config; per-project task and budget settings live in
`research_config.yaml`. See the
[configuration guide](https://RUC-NLPIR.github.io/Arbor/docs/configuration/) and
[`examples/research_config.example.yaml`](examples/research_config.example.yaml) for every
option.

---

## CLI Reference

Day to day you only need `arbor`:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `arbor` | Start an interactive research session. |
| `arbor setup` | Configure provider / model / keys → `~/.arbor/config.yaml`. |
| `arbor report <session>` | Re-render `REPORT.md` for a past session. |
| `arbor doctor` | Diagnose install, PATH, git, and API keys. |
| `arbor version` | Print the installed version. |

Lower-level entry points (`run-research`, `coordinator`, `executor`, `review-research`)
remain for debugging — see the [CLI reference](https://RUC-NLPIR.github.io/Arbor/docs/cli/).

---

## Plugins & Skills

A single line retargets the agent to a new domain — evaluation protocol, protected
data directories, required outputs, and timeout presets all come from the plugin:

```yaml
plugin: mle_kaggle   # switches to Kaggle/MLE mode
```

A plugin is one YAML file (prompt-injection points + config overrides + profiles +
lifecycle hooks + an eval contract); a Skill is a markdown playbook the agent loads on
demand at runtime. A copy-pasteable Kaggle config lives in
[`examples/kaggle_config.example.yaml`](examples/kaggle_config.example.yaml).

---

## Output & Resume

Each run writes a session directory with `REPORT.md`, `events.jsonl`, `run_stats.json`, the
Idea Tree, and per-experiment artifacts under `.arbor/sessions/`. Runs are resumable —
interrupt with `Ctrl+C` and continue later with `--resume`; Arbor reloads the Idea Tree and
picks up where it left off.

```bash
arbor report .arbor/sessions/<run_name>   # re-render a past report
arbor --resume --run-name <run_name>      # continue an interrupted run
```

---

## Results

Arbor was evaluated as a single controller across model training, harness engineering,
and data synthesis — only the material, objective, evaluator, and budget change. It
wins the held-out test on all six tasks against strong single-agent baselines.

| Task | Direction | Initial | Codex | Claude Code | **Arbor** | Gain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Optimizer Design | steps ↓ | 3325 | 3325 | 3287.5 | **3237.5** | +2.63% |
| Architecture Design | loss ↓ | 1.098 | 1.083 | 1.033 | **1.028** | +6.38% |
| Terminal-Bench 2.0 | pass ↑ | 69.81 | 73.59 | 71.70 | **77.36** | +7.55 |
| BrowseComp | acc ↑ | 45.33 | 50.00 | 53.33 | **67.67** | +22.34 |
| Search-Agent Data | gap ↑ | 5.00 | 9.00 | 12.00 | **18.00** | +13.0 |
| Math-Reasoning Data | gap ↑ | 1.04 | 6.25 | 8.33 | **20.83** | +19.79 |

On **MLE-Bench Lite** with GPT-5.5, Arbor reaches **86.36% Any-Medal** (100% valid
submissions, 95.45% above median, 77.27% gold). See the [paper](assets/arbor_paper.pdf)
for full protocols and ablations.
