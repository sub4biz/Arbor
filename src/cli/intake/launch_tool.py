"""LaunchExperiment tool — agent's signal that it's ready to start.

The tool does not actually launch anything. It records the plan into a
shared LaunchState object and returns a success message. The REPL polls
that state after each agent.run() turn; when set, it exits the loop and
hands the plan to the orchestrator.

We use shared state instead of exceptions because the existing Agent
class catches every tool exception and converts it into a tool error
result, so raising would just confuse the agent.
