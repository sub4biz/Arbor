"""Live dashboard for the coordinator run.

A single ``rich.live.Live`` view that owns the terminal while the
experiment is in flight. It has three regions, all rendered from
``RunState``:

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  arbor · <run_name>                         │
  │  cycle 3/5   ideas 12  ✓4 ✗5 ◌3   elapsed   │
  │  best 0.7421         phase DISPATCH         │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  recent activity
    15:42  ▸ executor n5 running …
    15:38  ↻ idea n3 merged 0.68 → 0.74
    …
  type a message to the agent  (Ctrl-C to abort) >

The activity region is a fixed-height rolling window — newest events
push old ones out the top, so the dashboard never scrolls the
terminal.

User input runs in a daemon thread that reads ``sys.stdin`` line by
line. Each line is queued on the state and surfaced inline; the agent
loop's inter-turn hook pulls messages off and injects them as fresh
user turns at the next opportunity.
