"""Experience recall: find prior runs whose lessons may help the current topic.

Each finished run leaves an ``EXPERIENCE.md`` in its session folder. When a new
run starts, intake scans past sessions, scores each against the current research
topic, and (if a strong match exists) asks the user whether to reuse it. Accepted
matches are composed into a tailored experience block for the agent.

Matching is deterministic keyword overlap here — cheap and good enough to gate
the ask; an embedding/LLM judge can replace ``_score`` later.
