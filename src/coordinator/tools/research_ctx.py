"""Coordinator tool: an on-demand external-knowledge / research assistant.

This is the grounded-ideation lane (roadmap 1.1). It is a general
external-knowledge tool the coordinator can call AT ANY TIME — not a mandatory
IDEATE step. Ideas can come from experiment results, internal reasoning, or the
literature; this tool is the optional input the coordinator reaches for when
EXTERNAL knowledge would help. It adapts to an ``intent``:

- ``related_work`` — find + assess prior work for a draft idea
- ``survey``       — organize how a field/problem is currently solved
- ``lookup``       — answer a specific factual question (method/dataset/number)
- ``explore``      — open-ended scan of a direction for gaps / open problems

It is deliberately SEPARATE from the post-experiment novelty audit in
:mod:`search_ctx`:

- **Novelty audit** (``SearchIdeaContext``) runs AFTER an experiment, on a
  validated node, in the background, and writes ``node.related_work``.
- **ResearchSearch** (here) runs on demand and **blocks** — its digest enters
  the coordinator's context so it can act on the knowledge. When a returned
  source shaped an idea, the citation is recorded on ``node.grounding`` (via
  ``TreeAddNode``), a field distinct from ``related_work``.

The two lanes never share fetched text: each runs its own fresh search in its
own isolated context. That is the "separation, not prohibition" integrity
guarantee — benchmark fairness comes from the ``grounded_ideation`` master
switch being OFF by default, not from muzzling what this agent may return.
