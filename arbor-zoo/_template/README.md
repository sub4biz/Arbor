# TODO_pack_name

One-line summary of the benchmark. Fill in the front-matter above (the machine contract)
and the four sections below — the verifier checks both, and they are what users and Arbor
read.

## Task & metric

What is the task, what does a solution look like, what number is optimized, and which
direction is better (maximize / minimize)? Name the **edit surface** — the baseline
code Arbor may change (one file like `solution.py`, or a whole set of files / a
directory) — and what is off-limits (the eval harness and any ground-truth files).

## Run the baseline

The exact commands and the score the shipped baseline prints. The eval entrypoint is
`eval.sh` (or `eval.py`), invoked with a split:

```bash
bash eval.sh dev     # iterate here
bash eval.sh test    # held-out gate
```

/ keys.

## Optimize with Arbor

How to point Arbor at this benchmark (copy it out of the Arbor checkout first, it uses
git worktrees) and the suggested research contract — metric, dev/test discipline, what
may and may not be edited.

## Provenance

See [`PROVENANCE.md`](PROVENANCE.md). Verify the benchmark with:

```bash
arbor benchmark verify arbor-zoo/<name>
```
